       STEPS:
       1. Create class Ticket who extends Item
       2. Create class Task who extends Item
       3. Create class TODO who extend Item
       4. Do implementation of class ProjectManagementSystemImpl
       5. Change changeTodoState method in interface ProjectManagementSystem as add parameters for it
       6. Remove the part of CommandParseImpl who initialize args and remove the field array of args
       7. Rewrite Application class were we should create task,todo or ticket. The first command that we enter have to be only CommantType after that if we choose one of this options, we have user interface to input all argument for creating an instant.
       8.  Make the method from interface Command Parser abstract.
